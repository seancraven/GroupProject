## Replicating the Results of this Project
First, we would recommend, using the environmen.yml.
```note
If you have a cuda enabled gpu there is environment_cuda.yml,
this is massively preffered as the experiment suite takes ~50 hours on RTX 3090.
```
To create the environment open the terminal on a Unix-like system;
```bash
conda env create -f environment<optional_cuda>.yml
```
